name = "linux-libc-auxv"
description = """
Linux passes an initial stack layout to applications, that contains `argc`, `argv`, `envp`, and the `auxiliary vector`
right above the stack pointer. The libc of a Linux program parses this sturcture in its `_start`-symbol ("crt0") and
passes the right pointers as arguments to `main` afterwards. This crate helps to construct and parse this data structure
in `no_std` environments and for different address spaces.
